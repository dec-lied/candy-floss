# candy-floss

My first and currently only neovim plugin and colorscheme that supports treesitter!

Initially built out of love for the colors of cotton candy then progressed into other colors as I saw fit.

Very heavily inspired by [nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon.nvim](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon.nvim)

## Important
I made this plugin for my own neovim setup, so some parts might not work for all neovim configs.
